/**
* @class NsmClient
*
* @brief Non session manager client implementation
*
* Non session management (NSM) is the name for both a standard/API
* allowing for a reproducible, multi-application session handling in
* Linux systems as well as for the actual application - the
* non-session-manager - implementing it.
*
* Hydrogen is compliant with the standard, send dirty flag to the NSM
* server to indicate unsaved changes, and is able to switch between
* different sessions without restarting the entire
* application. However, Hydrogen does use several files to store all
* options the user is able to customize and not all of them are stored
* inside the folder provided by the NSM server. While the song file
* will be kept there, both the drumkit and preferences are stored
* elsewhere. Altering either of them can very well affect the state of
* the individual session, e.g. by disabling a prior set the per track
* output option of the JACK driver outside of the session and
* restarting it. So, be very careful.

	/**
	 * Callback function for the NSM server to tell Hydrogen to open a
	 * H2Core::Song.
	 *
	 * This function has two separate purposes: 
	 * 1. it is used to load the
	 * initial session including its H2Core::Song and to set up the audio
	 * driver when started via the NSM server. 
	 * 2. It handles the switching
	 * between sessions by loading the H2Core::Song, the
	 * H2Core::Preferences, and the H2Core::Drumkit of the new session
	 * without the need to restart the whole application.
	 *
	 * To fulfill the 1. purpose, it is important to know that the
	 * core part of H2Core::Hydrogen is already initialized when this
	 * function is called, but the GUI isn't. In order to allow for a
	 * rewiring of all per track JACK output ports, the
	 * H2Core::JackAudioDriver::init() function _must_ register them
	 * alongside the main left and right output ports in the very
	 * initialization and not at a later stage. Therefore, the
	 * starting of the audio driver is prohibited whenever the
	 * "NSM_URL" environmental variable is set,
	 * H2Core::Hydrogen::setInitialSong() is used to store the loaded
	 * H2Core::Song, and H2Core::Hydrogen::restartDrivers() to start
	 * the audio driver and - if JACK is chosen - to create all per
	 * track output ports right away. In addition, is also calls
	 * H2Core::Hydrogen::restartLadspaFX() and
	 * H2Core::Sampler::reinitialize_playback_track() to set up the
	 * missing core parts of Hydrogen.
	 *
	 * In the 2. case of switching between session the function will
	 * construct an Action of type "OPEN_SONG" - or "NEW_SONG" if no file
	 * exists with the provided file path - triggering
	 * MidiActionManager::open_song() or
	 * MidiActionManager::new_song().
	 *
	 * If the GUI is present, it waits - up to 11 seconds - until the
	 * H2Core::Song was asynchronously set by the GUI (as a response
	 * to the action). This (regular) procedure is only done if a GUI
	 * is present and fully loaded and thus
	 * H2Core::Hydrogen::m_GUIState is set to H2Core::Hydrogen::GUIState::ready.
	 *
	 * All files and symbolic links will be stored in a folder created
	 * by this function and named according to @a name.
	 *
	 * \param name Unique name corresponding to the current session. A
	 * folder using this particular \a name will be created, which will
	 * contain the H2Core::Song - using \a name appended by ".h2song" as
	 * file name -, the local H2Core::Preferences, and a symbolic link to
	 * the H2Core::Drumkit in use.
	 * \param displayName Name the application will be presented with by
	 * the NSM server. It is determined in
	 * NsmClient::createInitialClient() and set to "Hydrogen".
	 * \param clientID Unique prefix also present in \a name, "nJKUV". It
	 * will be stored in H2Core::Preferences::m_sNsmClientId to provide it
	 * as a suffix when creating a JACK client in 
	 * H2Core::JackAudioDriver::init().
	 * \param outMsg Unused argument. Kept for API compatibility.
	 * \param userData Unused argument. Kept for API compatibility.
	 *
	 *  \return 
	 * - ERR_OK (0): indicating that everything worked fine.
	 * - ERR_LAUNCH_FAILED (-4): If no \a clientID provided, the H2Core::Song
	 * corresponding to the file path of a concatenation of \a name and
	 * ".h2song" could not be loaded, or the Action could not be provided
	 * to MidiActionManager::handleAction().
	 * - ERR_NOT_NOW (-8): If the H2Core::Preferences instance was
	 * not initialized.
